                    <ul class="inner-list">
                        <li>Fixed an issue where replacing schedules would result in teams playing two games per week, and sometimes no games per week.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where games in later seasons would be replaced in the wrong week, resulting in some games played at incorrect times.</li>
                        <li>Replacing all games will now correctly parse the game time and populate the Scheduler.Appointment table start time.</li>

                    <ul class="inner-list">
                        <li>Added an easy table reference editor to the table editor. Hover over a cell with a reference to another table and click the edit button to see it.</li>
                        <li>You can easily customize the reference target table and index from the modal popup.</li>

                    <ul class="inner-list">
                        <li>Added each table's table id in parentheses in the table picker dropdown.</li>
                        <li>Added ability to search for only the table index, only the table id, or only the table name.</li>
                        <li>If you search for an exact match of any of the above, the table will be brought to the top of the results.</li>
                        <li>You can also search for array tables (Ex: Player[]) as long as you put the starting '[' and ending ']' in the search. If you only put one '[' the search will not work.</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where some table column widths were off. This will not be perfect but should be better.</li>

                        <li>Request - this schema has the correct attributes but incorrect order. Please be careful editing any of these tables.</li>
                        <li>Scheduler - contains list of game appointments, epoch time, and current time. Essential for simming games correctly.</li>
                        <li>Scheduler.DateTime - this schema allows you to customize an appointment's date or time. Doesn't have a big effect on games, though.</li>
                        <li>Scheduler.Appointment - All games (and other things in the season) have appointments. This table is used to determine which games to sim and when.</li>
                        <li>Scheduler.RelativeAppt - This schema contains attributes for editing relative appointments for the Scheduler.Appointment table.</li>
                        <li>Scheduler.RelativeApptDateTime - Same as above but with a date/time.</li>
                        <li>SeasonScheduleManager - the top level element/class for schedules</li>
                        <li>SeasonScheduleManager.SeasonScheduleTunableData - items related to schedule generation after each offseason. The attributes may not be in the correct order.</li>
                        <li>SeasonScheduleManager.SeasonScheduleWeeklyGameInfo - these control generated schedule start times on each day of the week.</li>
