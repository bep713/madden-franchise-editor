                            The below changes will allow the app to auto-adjust to the new changes as the game updates.</p>
                        <li>Added a schema management system that allows you to save custom schemas.</li>
                        <li>Added a service that allows you to scan the game files for updated schemas.</li>
                        <li>Added an alert message that shows when you open a file without an exact schema match saved.</li>
